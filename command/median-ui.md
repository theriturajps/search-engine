## Supplementary instructions

**znew command** is used to convert the ".Z" compressed package compressed using the compress command into a ".gz" compressed package compressed using the gzip command.

###  grammar

```shell
znew(option)(parameter)
```

### Options

```shell
-f: # Force the conversion operation, that is, the target ".gz" already exists;
-t: # Test the new file before deleting the original file;
-v: # Display the file name and compression ratio of each file;
-9: # Use the highest compression rate, slower;
-P: # Use pipes to complete the conversion operation to reduce disk space usage;
-K: # When the ".Z" file is smaller than the ".gz" file, keep the ".Z" file.
```
